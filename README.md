#### Overview:

---

In the [sentiment analysis notebook](./sentiment-analysis.ipynb), we introduce
TFIDF vectors, a way of encoding documents into a vector representation.  

We then use some `scikit-learn` classifiers to predict the sentiment of movie
reviews (positive or negative).  Finally, we use a tool called `lime` to
interpret what words in our document are relevant to our classification.
